# annotate
Annotation App for Sandstorm

# Using

Annotate is a Sandstorm app. It's not yet on the app store. I'll provide a package for download soon. 

# Development

Annotate uses Meteor:

```
$ mkdir annotate
$ git clone git@github.com:simonv3/annotate.git .
$ meteor
```

And you should be good to go!
